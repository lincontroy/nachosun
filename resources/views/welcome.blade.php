                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From your self-assessment, it enables you to know how much KRA owes you, if any. It also allows
                        you to determine if you have any tax due and, if so, how much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> KRA returns must be filed; without filing, you may face penalties as a
                        citizen.

                                Company registration in Kenya is the process of legally establishing a business as a
                                separate entity
                                under the law, giving it the authority to operate within the country. The registration
                                is overseen by
                                the Registrar of Companies, part of the Business Registration Service (BRS) under the
                                Office of the
                                Attorney General. Once registered, the company is recognized as a legal entity capable
                                of entering
                                contracts, owning property, suing, and being sued.

            <br><br>

            <h2>Requirements for Business Registration</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choosing a Business Structure:</strong> Decide on a legal structure for your business (e.g., sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, LLC) based on factors like liability, taxation, and management.</li>
                <li><strong>Choosing a Business Name:</strong> Select a unique name that reflects your business and complies with local naming regulations. Check for name availability and trademarks.</li>
                <li><strong>Filing Required Documents:</strong> Complete and submit necessary forms and documents to the appropriate government agency, such as articles of incorporation or operating agreements.</li>
                <li><strong>Obtaining Licenses and Permits:</strong> Depending on your business type and location, obtain specific licenses or permits to operate legally, including health permits, zoning permits, or professional licenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Registration:</strong> Register for any required taxes, such as sales tax, income tax, or employer taxes. This may involve obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN).</li>
                <li><strong>Complying with Ongoing Requirements:</strong> After registration, fulfill ongoing obligations, such as filing annual reports, maintaining proper records, and renewing licenses.</li>
            </ol>

            <br><br>

            <h2>Importance of Business Registration</h2>
            <p>
                Business registration is important as it establishes your business as a legal entity, provides liability protection, and can enhance credibility with customers and suppliers.
